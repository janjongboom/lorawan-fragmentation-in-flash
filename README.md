# Firmware update on Multi-Tech xDot with forward error correction

This is a demonstration application which uses the LoRaWAN data fragmentation proposal schema to apply a firmware update on a Multi-Tech xDot.

It:

* Demonstrates how to use [mbed-lorawan-frag-lib](https://github.com/janjongboom/mbed-lorawan-frag-lib) - a library for Low-Density Parity Encoding - to store an incoming firmware update in flash and use forward error correction to fix missing packets.
* Stores all firmware packets in external flash (AT45 SPI Flash).
* Integrates with the a [bootloader](https://github.com/armmbed/mbed-bootloader), which will check the flash on startup, and uses the FlashIAP API to perform the firmware update.
* Verifies that firmware was signed by a trusted party using ECDSA/SHA256 with public key held on device, and private key held by manufacturer.

You can run this application without access to a LoRaWAN network. [fota-lora-radio](https://github.com/armmbed/fota-lora-radio) uses the same libraries but also comes with a LoRaWAN stack.

## Package format

A firmware packet consists of a number of blocks, defined in the `UpdateSignature_t` type:

* ECDSA/SHA256 signature of the actual firmware (71 bytes).
* Manufacturer UUID.
* Device Class UUID.
* Diff header (4 bytes).
* Actual firmware.

These blocks should be concatenated, see `create-packets-h.js`.

## How to get started

1. Install mbed CLI and the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain 6.
1. Import this repository:

    ```
    $ mbed import https://github.com/janjongboom/lorawan-fragmentation-in-flash
    ```

1. Build the application:

    ```
    $ mbed compile -m FF1705_L151CC -t GCC_ARM
    ```

1. Combine the application with the bootloader:

    ```
    $ python tools/combine_bootloader_with_app.py -a BUILD/FF1705_L151CC/GCC_ARM/lorawan-fragmentation-in-flash.bin -b bootloader/FF1705_L151CC.bin -m FF1705_L151CC -o BUILD/FF1705_L151CC/GCC_ARM/combined.bin
    ```

1. Flash `BUILD/FF1705_L151CC/GCC_ARM/combined.bin` on your [L-TEK FF1705](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/L-TEK-FF1705/) development board (or other xDot with AT45 SPI Flash).
1. Attach a serial monitor at baud rate 115,200 to see the update happening.

You can fake packet loss by commenting lines in `src/packets.h`.

## Program outline

The program:

1. Initializes the flash driver.
1. Initializes a fragmentation session.
1. Feeds packets (from `packets.h`) into the fragmentation session, until the session is complete.
1. Calculates CRC64 hash of the packet.
    * Send this hash to your LoRaWAN network provider in a `DATABLOCK_AUTH_REQ` message, for verification.
1. Calculates SHA256 hash of the packet (starting at offset 256, ignoring the signature).
1. Verifies the SHA256 hash against the public key in `UpdateCerts.h` through ECDSA.
1. If everything is OK, writes an `UpdateParams_t` struct to flash. The bootloader checks for this struct for update instructions.

To automatically restart the board when the program finishes, invoke `NVIC_SystemReset()`.

## How to add a flash driver

If you're using a different flash chip, you'll need to implement the [BlockDevice](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api-reference/en/latest/APIs/storage/block_device/) interface. See `AT45BlockDevice.h` in the `at45-blockdevice` driver for more information.

## Updating the application

Currently the demo application is a simple blinky application, as it needs to be held in flash (which the xDot has little). If you want to update the application:

1. Copy the `_application.bin` file to the `test-fw` directory.
1. Run:

    ```
    $ node create-packets-h.js my-app_application.bin ../src/packets.h
    ```
